Description: web browser plugin for BankID
 FriBID is a web browser plugin for BankID, a kind of electronic ID
 (e-legitmiation) that's used in Sweden. It supports file-based
 electronic IDs (e-legitimation på fil) and card-based IDs (e-legitimation
 på kort), with some limitations:
 .
  * The new file formats (NGE/NGP) from the official client with version
    4.15.0.14 aren't supported.
  * It's not possible to fetch new file-based IDs.
  * To change your password/PIN you need to use other programs.
  * To use card-based IDs you needs some configuration,
    see http://wiki.fribid.se/sidor/SmartCards (in Swedish).
 .
 FriBID is only compatible with the second version of BankID, and not
 the older system that uses Java applets.
