Description: web browser plugin for BankID
 FriBID is a web browser plugin for BankID, a kind of electronic ID
 (e-legitmiation) that's used in Sweden. Currently, it only supports
 file-based electronic IDs (e-legitimation på fil), and it's not
 possible to obtain or renew electronic IDs with this version.
 .
 FriBID is only compatible with the second version of BankID, and not
 the older system that uses Java applets.
