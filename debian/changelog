fribid (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a crash that occured with certain certificate/identity files.
    Thanks to Magnus Carlson who tracked down this bug.
  * Made FriBID look for certificates/identity files in ~/.cbt as well
    as ~/cbt. Thanks to Magnus Carlson for this patch.
  * Made it possible to specifify a path for the library files. Normally
    these are stored in /usr/lib/, but some distributions store them
    in /usr/lib64/ on 64-bit platforms (for example Slackware).
  * Added an ASN1 dumping tool, which can be used to analyze certificate/
    identity files.
  * Small improvements in performance and documentation fixes.

fribid (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug with optimized builds that caused passwords to not be
    cleared from RAM when they where no longer needed.
  * Fixed a compatibility problem with sites that request signing
    without specifying a subject (personal number).
  * Implemented "non-visible data", which is used in signatures at some
    sites, such as Skatteverket.
  * A better random source is now used for the encryption keys for the
    temporary NSS database.
