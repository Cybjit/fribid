fribid (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug with optimized builds that caused passwords to not be
    cleared from RAM when they where no longer needed.
  * Fixed a compatibility problem with sites that request signing
    without specifying a subject (personal number).
  * Implemented "non-visible data", which is used in signatures at some
    sites, such as Skatteverket.
  * A better random source is now used for the encryption keys for the
    temporary NSS database.
