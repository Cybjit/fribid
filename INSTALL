To build FriBID you need the following software:

  * A C99 compiler (like gcc)
  * A make-compatible program (like GNU make or BSD pmake)
  * pkg-config
  * gettext
  * GTK 2.12 or later
  * GLib 2.8 or later
  * NSS 3.10 or later
  * NSPR 4
  * And development files (headers) for the four
    libraries above.

To build and install FriBID on a Unix-like system with sudo, use the
following command:

    ./configure && make && sudo make install

This will perform a system-wide installation, so FriBID will be available
for all users. If you only want to install FriBID on your own user account,
you can use the following command (which doesn't require administrative
rights):

    ./configure --current-user && make && make install

This will install FriBID on your user account only.
